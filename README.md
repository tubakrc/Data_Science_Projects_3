# Holiday Events Analysis - Walmart Sales Prediction⚾👷🏻‍♀👷🏻‍♂🦃🎄

## Problem: Predicting sales in the retail industry using Machine Learning Algorithms.

### 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build an effective machine learning solution for Walmart, one of the leading retail stores in the US, to accurately predict sales and demand.

### 🔍 Business Problem

* Walmart often faces challenges due to unforeseen demand, leading to stockouts.
* Current machine learning algorithms fail to adequately account for external factors, resulting in inaccuracies.

### 📊 Data Insights

**Scope:** Historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across various regions in the US.

**Key Factors Influencing Sales:**

*Holidays & Events:* Prominent holidays like Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

*Economic Indicators:* CPI (Consumer Price Index), Unemployment Index.

*Markdown Events:* Seasonal promotional markdowns preceding major holidays.

*Holiday Weighting:* Weeks including major holidays are weighted five times higher than non-holiday weeks.

### 🚀 Project Goals

* Develop a robust ML algorithm to accurately predict demand and sales.
* Account for factors like economic conditions and promotional markdowns.
* Handle incomplete historical data for holiday weeks effectively.
* Model the effects of markdowns on sales during major holiday weeks.

### 🌟 Expected Outcomes

* Improved accuracy in demand forecasting.
* Enhanced inventory planning and stock availability.
* Better alignment of markdown events with predicted holiday demands.
