## Problem: Predicting sales in the retail industry using Machine Learning Algorithms.

### üìå Project Overview
This project aims to build an effective machine learning solution for Walmart, one of the leading retail stores in the US, to accurately predict sales and demand.

I applied 5(five) Regression Models--> Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic-Net Regression, and Polynomial Regression for predicting Sales and evaluated the model scores for comparison (R2, RMSE, RSS and MSE).

### üîç Business Problem

* Walmart often faces challenges due to unforeseen demand, leading to stockouts.
* Current machine learning algorithms fail to adequately account for external factors, resulting in inaccuracies.

### üìä Data Insights

**Scope:** Historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across various regions in the US.

**Key Factors Influencing Sales:**

* *Holidays & Events:* Prominent holidays like Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

* *Economic Indicators:* CPI (Consumer Price Index), Unemployment Index.

* *Markdown Events:* Seasonal promotional markdowns preceding major holidays.

* *Holiday Weighting:* Weeks including major holidays are weighted five times higher than non-holiday weeks.

* The dataset is taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset).

### üöÄ Project Goals

* Develop a robust ML algorithm to accurately predict demand and sales.
* Account for factors like economic conditions and promotional markdowns.
* Handle incomplete historical data for holiday weeks effectively.
* Model the effects of markdowns on sales during major holiday weeks.

### üåü Expected Outcomes

* Improved accuracy in demand forecasting.
* Enhanced inventory planning and stock availability.
* Better alignment of markdown events with predicted holiday demands.
